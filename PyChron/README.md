# PyChron

A modern, desktop time-tracking application built with Python and CustomTkinter. Track time spent on tasks with multiple sessions, add notes, and export your data in multiple formats.

**PyChron** combines "Python" with "Chronos," the Greek personification of time—a sharp and professional name for a time-tracking tool.

```

## 🔧 Configuration

The application stores data in `tasks.json` in the same directory as `main.py`. This file is automatically created and updated as you use the application.

### Data Persistence

- All task data is automatically saved when:
  - A task is created, edited, or deleted
  - A task is completed or uncompleted
  - A session is started or paused
  - Notes are added or edited
  - Session names are changed
- Data is stored in JSON format for easy inspection and backup
- The file is created automatically on first use

## 📊 Export Formats

### CSV Export
- Comma-separated values
- Includes: Task Name, Session, Start Time, End Time, Duration, Session Note, Task Note
- Excel-compatible

### JSON Export
- Structured JSON format
- Preserves all task data including notes and session details
- Easy to parse programmatically

### XLSX Export
- Native Excel format
- Same columns as CSV
- Requires `openpyxl` library

### Copy to Clipboard
- Tab-separated format
- Includes headers
- Paste directly into Excel or Google Sheets

## 🎨 Themes

Switch between Light and Dark themes using the toggle in the top-right corner. The theme preference is not currently persisted between sessions.

**Note**: Due to CustomTkinter's internal widget rebuilding mechanism, theme switching may cause a brief visual refresh. All custom widget colors are updated manually to minimize disruption.

## 🖼️ Custom Icons

The application supports custom window icons. To use a custom icon:

1. Place an `icon.ico` or `app.ico` file in the `PyChron` directory
2. The application will automatically detect and use it
3. The icon will appear in the taskbar and window title bar

If no custom icon is found, the default Python icon will be used.

## 🛠️ Development

### Code Structure

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **Models**: Data structures (`Task` class)
- **Handlers**: Business logic and event handling
- **UI**: User interface components and dialogs
- **Storage**: Data persistence layer
- **Export**: Data export functionality
- **Utils**: Helper functions

### Adding Features

The modular structure makes it easy to extend:

- Add new export formats in `export/exporter.py`
- Add new dialogs in `ui/dialogs.py`
- Extend the Task model in `models/task.py`
- Add new handlers in `handlers.py`
